RR-P - Team Project - Flight Booking Form 
**POD 2 Group 3** 
**Team Members:** Leigh Grigaliunas, Dona Thomas, Lekshmi Midhun, Sandeep Kumar(?)

**Project Brief:** Create a booking form for an online airline. Capture details from client, validate input and process payment.

Basic project outline is as follows:  

- create wireframe(s)
- create html file(s)
- create css file(s)
- create javascript file(s) for validation (to be split among the team)
- create javascript testing file(s) using mocha as we go
- finalise web app
- deploy final to github
- display via github pages
- share final project with instructors and peers
- create powerpoint and present to instructors and peers

Considerations:

The team has agreed to focus on the main booking form initially. If we get through that in a timely manner, we'll look at adding in a signup and/or login page.

**Final Presentation**

We did it! Woo hoo. A little stressful, but the job got done in the end.
